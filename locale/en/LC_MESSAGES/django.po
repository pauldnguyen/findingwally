"Wally has gone out in search of adventure again! Perhaps you have heard of "
"him from his famous series of books <i>Where's Wally?</i> full of his many "
"pictures from various exotic times and places. As usual, he likes to hide "
"somewhere at each location so that his friends can have fun looking for him."

"That search for him is now easier than ever before with this new tool that "
"detects him using a powerful technique from machine learning: the artificial "
"neural network. This system is made up of a collection of connected units "
"called artificial neurons, which are reminiscent of neurons in a brain. "
"These artificial neurons process the data, and transfer them to the next "
"neurons until the data reaches an output node indicating a decision. To "
"calibrate the connections between neurons, the network trains itself by "
"taking appropriate data through the network, and adjusting the connections "
"to reduce errors in the final predictions. After it learns Wally's different "
"features from images with him and those without him, this model is able to "
"detect his location in new images."
