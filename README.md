Finding Wally Web Application

An adaption of the work done by [Tadej Magajna](https://github.com/tadejmagajna/HereIsWally) as a web application on the PythonAnywhere webhosting service.

# Languages

Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

# Requirements

The images, annotations, and trained model from [Tadej Magajna](https://github.com/tadejmagajna/HereIsWally); or alternatively, create separate similar images, annotations, to retrained the model derived from his work, or to trained a model from scratch. For simply implementing a Web application to predict Wally's location (and not training a new model), only a frozen inference graph (the trained model) is needed, and found on his repository.

[TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) and its dependencies for both training and prediction

To generate detection plots:

[matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

[NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

Backend framework:

[Django](https://github.com/django/django)
